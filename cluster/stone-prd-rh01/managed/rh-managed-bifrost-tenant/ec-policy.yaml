    Rules specifically related to levels 1, 2 & 3 of SLSA v0.1, plus a set of
    basic checks that are expected to pass for all RHTAP builds. Available
    collections are defined in
    https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/ec-policies/release_policy.html#_available_rule_collections.
    If a different policy configuration is desired, this resource can serve as a
    starting point. See the docs on how to include and exclude rules
    https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.stonesoup.io/ec-policies/policy_configuration.html#_including_and_excluding_rules.
